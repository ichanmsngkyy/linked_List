**Linked List**

---git pu

This is a Ruby project from The Odin Project. It implements a linked list using an array since Ruby doesn't have a built-in linked list class.
The linked list includes a "head" and a "tail" node, with nil at the end to signify the termination of the list. It also features several methods, such as #append, #prepend, #contains, #find, and many more.
